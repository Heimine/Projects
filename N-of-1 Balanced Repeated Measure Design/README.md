# N-of-1 Balanced Repeated Measure Design
2019.06 - Now
## Basic Information
This folder contains algorithms and trails about n-of-1 balanced repeated measure design. This research project is under supervision of [Prof. Ying Lu](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ying-lu). The primary focus is to find an algorithm which could produce the shortest sequences that are balanced in terms of first order, second order and etc based on requirements and prove the supremacy in terms of efficiency and accuracy of these sequences compared to random assigned sequence of treatments when it comes to, for example, finding the best treatment or treatment combination for a certain patient.(e.g, ABBAA is a balanced first order sequence with two treatments (AB), where "AA", "AB", "BA", "BB" all apear once and only once in the sequence, the problem will become more complex when we consider higher orders or more treatments).
