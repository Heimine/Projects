# Exploring techniques to predict employee attrition using dataset from IBM
2018.11 - 2018.12
## Basic Information
This project was a term group project for Programming for Data Science (DS-GA 1007) with Jingrou Wei, Yi Nian and Xuan Wang. The idea of the project is using a dataset created by IBM (1) including 1470 instances with each instance as a employee, 34 features containing Age, Maritual Status, Monthly Income and etc and target variable "Attrition" as a binary class with "Yes" or "No" as its value. The project aims for discovering relationships between features and the Attrition status, finding a best model for predicting Attritions and trying to find out methods and opinion for the company to reduce attrition rate.

## Personal Contribution
Did Exploratory Analysis
Did data preprocessing and implemented base line models including Decition Tree, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine;
Implemented feature reduction by mutual information;
Implemented Random Forest;
Did parameter tuning to find the best model;
Made cumulative gain curves and try to come up with solutions for reducing attrition rate.
