# Scattering Transform and CNN for Medical Image Classification 
2019.04 - 2019.05
This project mainly focus on testing the effect of scattering transform for medical image classification tasks. The datasets used for this project include fundus images for diabetic retinopathy screening which come from two sources: [E ophtha](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.irbm.2013.01.010) and [DIARETDB](http://www.it.lut.fi/project/imageret/diaretdb1/); the other dataset contains microscopic histopathological images of breast tumor tissue, comes from [Breast Cancer Histopathological Database](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/breast-cancer-histopathological-database-breakhis/).
